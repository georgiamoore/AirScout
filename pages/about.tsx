        </h2>
        <Typography>
          Outdoor air pollution is a major concern for public health worldwide.
          According to the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/every-breath-we-take-lifelong-impact-air-pollution"

          , pollution is estimated to cause around 40,000 deaths annually.
          Health problems stemming from pollutant exposure are estimated to cost
          the UK more than Â£20 billion each year.
          <br />
          The ability to monitor and understand air pollution is therefore
          incredibly important. This system aims to provide this data in a way
          that enables informed decision making, and to help people understand
          the impact of air pollution on their health.
