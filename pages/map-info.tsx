          The pollutant map displays the average levels of various air
          pollutants over the past 24 hours measured by the Universityâ€™s air
          quality monitoring network, as well as data from across the West
          Midlands provided by external sources such as Defra. For more
          information on data sources, please visit the{" "}

          The pollutants included on the map are ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide
          (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10).

          How to use the map
        </h2>
        <Typography>
          On the map, you will see circular markers like this for each sensor
          site in the region:
          <img
            alt="A circle marker on the map, used to represent a sensor site."
            src="/marker.png"
          ></img>
          Clicking on one of these markers will open a popup showing the average
          pollutant value for the last 24 hours, as well as graphs of any
          available contextual information such as temperature.
          <img
            alt="The popup for an individual sensor site."
            src="/popup.png"
          ></img>
          Zooming out shows a grid of hexagons - these hexagons show a
          prediction of the average pollutant values across the region, using
          spatial interpolation based on existing values to estimate values for
          areas without sensors.
          <br />
          For example, in this image, the sensor in Birmingham city centre has a
          much lower pollutant value than those surrounding it, so the grid is
          coloured green in this area.
          <img
            alt="A grid of hexagons overlaying the map, colour-coded by average pollutant value in this area."
            src="/interpolation.png"
          ></img>
        </Typography>
        <br />
      </div>
    </main>
  );

export default MapInfo;
